# Homebrew-Stud

A formula for installing [stud](https://github.com/bumptech/stud), which can not be included in Homebrew until the developers [tag a build](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/10989).

This formula is based on the [formula](https://github.com/paulnicholson/homebrew/blob/423ed337a93dad51d1d4a12b493d95c0c40f3e0d/Library/Formula/stud.rb) from the pull request to Homebrew by [paulnicholson](https://github.com/paulnicholson/homebrew/blob/423ed337a93dad51d1d4a12b493d95c0c40f3e0d/Library/Formula/stud.rb).

## Requirements

* Homebrew
* Mountain Lion. Probably works on Lion and Snow Leopard, but untested.
